github-fluid-userscript
=======================

A userscript for managing a github repo a little easier (with a focus on pull requests).  
Designed with organization use in mind, less so for managing disparate projects, but the code for
scattered projects is in the history (it was removed with: https://github.com/bigethan/github-fluid-userscript/commit/c0489fbb9a95db6537bd224e5aaba38338cec8de#github-fluid.user.js)

Features:
- give it a list of usernames, and it'll:
 - badge the app when they submit a new pull request
 - note when one their pull requests is unread
- If a word matches a specified pattern, it can create a link for that item.  Handy if you use http://foo.com/BUG-56 instead of gihub's issues
- when a pull reuest comes it, it'll bounce the app's icon once in the dock.
