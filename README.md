github-fluid-userscript
=======================

A userscript for managing a github repo a little easier (with a focus on pull requests)

Features:
- give it a list of usernames, and it'll:
-- badge the app when they submit a new pull request
-- note when one their pull requests is unread
- If a word matches a specified pattern, it can create a link for that item.  Handy if you use http://foo.com/BUG-56 instead of gihub's issues
